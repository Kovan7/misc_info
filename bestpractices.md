# How to Stay Secure Online

  A lot of people online feel overwhelmed by the number and complextiy of attacks, hacks, ransomeware and other malicious acts
putting them at risk on the internet.  On one end, it may be impossible to protect yourself from the resources and persitnence of 
governments and organizations that seem to be magically gifted at hacking (such as the notorious NSO Group).  On the other, it can be easy to put a few practices in place to keep yourself safe.  But with a little bit of effort, we can protect ourselves from 99% of all malicious activity online.  

1. Password Manager
	One of the easiest ways for attackers to gain unauthorized access is by trying passwords on multiple accounts which a user repeats.  Don't repeat your passwords.  It is easier than ever to encorporate a Password Manager into you life.  I recommend 1Password, but there are several reputable ones.  This allows you to make large, complex passwords that can be impossible to guess and near impossible to break.  It also enables users to easily have different passwords for each account.  This way, if one of your accounts gets breached, others don't go with it.  
	
	You only need one master password to work your Password Manager - and yes some might say, "Well then you only have one password which can lead to multiple account breaches."  And you would be kind of right.  But it is much easier to lock down one large, complex password for an account with Multi-Factor Authentication than hundreds.  Yes, you have hundreds of accounts, try counting them.  And you get the added bonus of knowing all those other accounts are secured as much as you can make them.  Come on people, use a password manager.  
	
2. Encryption
	It's easier than ever to utilize encryption for your private information and communications.  Tools like Veracrypt (dated but still secure) can be used on your personal machines to keep files private.  Applications like Signal and Telegram enable excellent encryption to keep your chat, files, voice and video secure.  Email can encorporate public and private keys, which can be a little tricky, but there are tons of tutorials out there.  Like this one: <placeholder website link>   and this one < another link >  and countless others.  
	
3. Utilize that Phishing/Spam Button for Email
	Gmail, Outlook, whatever email tool you use, there is an easy button at the top to report for phishing/spam.  Use it!  If you get an email that's suspect, too good to be true, from a user you may not know, smack that button.  It's easy to report it and you never have to worry about clicking on something weird.  Sure, some phishing emails look very good, and that's harder, but check the email it was sent from, check the links, and if you still have questions, don't click the links, just go to the websites and check for yourself.  
	
4. VPNs
	How often is this dead horse beat.  Just use them, they're easy, they're fast and in most cases can save your butt when you travel or are just surfing the web out and about.  Any time you connect to an internet that you don't own, you should be using a VPN.  Proton, Nord, PrivacyVPN and more.  Your internet activity can easily be scooped up by lurkers like me, just running Wireshark on a public wifi.  Use a VPN and your activity is encrypted.  That's it.  
	
5. Finally
	Check out sites like [haveibeenpwned] to see if your emails have shown up in data breaches.  This will let you know which breaches involved your email.  Then make sure you change that password anywhere it was used.  Passwords are usually scooped up and just added to large text files which are used when attackers attempt to brute force their way into accounts.  
	
There are lots of ways to stay secure online, but unfortunately there are lots of ways to leak your personal information.  These days, people are so quick to click, like, and thumbs-up things that they rarely take a minute to think about any ramifications.  Take a few seconds to think about all the things you do online, take a few steps to ensure your data is being protected by using the steps above and you'll be better off in most cases.  It isn't fool-proof, but it's a huge step forward in protecting yourself online.
